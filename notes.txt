Let's get Hooked:
-----------------
React makes coding experiences very fast optimises the things to make web page faster.
The best practice is make a seperate file for seperate components.
Keep all source files in src folder.
create components folder for writing sepearate components.
We can use .js or .jsx and for typescript .tsx as extension
Before importing any component we need to export the component.
Even if we don't put extension in import for component it will work.
Whenever you have hardcoded/mock data never keep it in component file.
There are two type of exports 1.default, 2.named export/import.
Can we use default export along with named export????
Good practice is keep component small and clean.
React fast/efficient in DOM manipulation, to tie/sync data layer consistant with ui layer.
State variable in react - super powerful variable. called hooks  - useState.
React Hooks are normal js functions. Two very imp hooks and are useState(), useEffect().
-useState() - Super powerful state variables in react
for spatial variable like useState we can't directly update its data. use setData parameter.
Whenever a state variable changes react will re render the component. this re rendering of the dom/component is super power of react.
Reconciliation Algorithm (React Fiber)
Virtual DOM is representation of actual DOM. Virtual DOM is nothing but a js object.
Diff algorithm which is efficient finds difference between 2 virtual DOMS (current vs previous) and update the actul DOM on every render cycle.
React FIber after React16 which is new way of finding diff b/w virtual DOM.
Whenever there is a change in state variable it will find a diff in virtual DOMs and update the UI/DOM.
