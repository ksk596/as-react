Talk is cheap, show me code:
----------------------------
Planning for food ordering app:
Name an app - EatRight
Header - have logo at left, links like home, about and cart in right side
In Body - Search bar with search button.
Restro cards for diff restaurents.
One card can have color with image, title, rating, cuisines, price, promotions and other can have other customs
Footer - copyrights, links.

We can write inline styles in JSX as Javascript object.
Props are just normal arguements to a function.
Passing a prop to a component is like a passing an arguement to a function.
When we want to pass data dynamically to component we use props.
Config driven UI - Controlling how the UI looks by data/config, which is coming from backend.
Each child in a list should have an unique key property - console warning while rendering list items.
Whenever we are looping onto list we need to provide key which will work as unique id. here we will pass resto id as key.
React doesn't know what are the new data added at start/inbetween if we don't provide keys so it will cleans the container and rerender all the data.
If we provide the keys while looping, react reload only new data(optimization) which is added instead loading all.
Few developers use index as keys. But React itself says we don't recommend using indexes for keys if the order of items may change. This can negatively impacts performance and may cause issues with component state.
